# Machine Learning Webcam

An application built using Angular and TensorFlow.

## Why Build a Machine Learning Webcam App?

I wanted a way to distract my cat Gomez from jumping up on my kitchen counter.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
